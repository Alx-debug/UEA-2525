# Campaign Vaccination Data

This console application generates a fictitious list of 500 citizens and randomly assigns vaccinations:

- 75 citizens vaccinated with Pfizer
- 75 citizens vaccinated with AstraZeneca

Using set theory operations it produces:

- Citizens that have not been vaccinated
- Citizens that received both vaccines
- Citizens that only received the Pfizer vaccine
- Citizens that only received the AstraZeneca vaccine

To run the program you need the .NET SDK installed:

```bash
dotnet run --project CovidVaccination
```
